# Torch Pitch Shift

Pitch-shift audio clips quickly with PyTorch (CUDA supported)! Additional utilities for searching efficient transformations are included.

## About

This package includes two main features:
* Pitch-shift audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
* Calculate efficient pitch-shift targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise pitch-shifts)

> Also check out [torch-time-stretch](https://github.com/KentoNishi/torch-time-stretch), a sister project for time-stretching.

## Installation
